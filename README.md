# Fake News Detection

In this project, I developed a fake news detection model using Logistic Regression and the TF-IDF vectorizer to identify whether a news article is real or fake.

The dataset, WELFake_Dataset.csv, contains news articles with labels indicating their authenticity.

The workflow includes data preprocessing, text vectorization, model training, and evaluation using accuracy, F1-score, and ROC-AUC to assess performance.
